## Development Setup

### 🔄 Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your LLM API keys (only set the ones you plan to use):
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
HuggingFace_API_KEY=XXX
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=XXX
...
```
   - Optionally set debug level:
```bash
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

   - Optionally set context size:
```bash
DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=32768
```

Some Example Context Values for the qwen2.5-coder:32b models are.
 
* DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=32768 - Consumes 36GB of VRAM
* DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=24576 - Consumes 32GB of VRAM
* DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=12288 - Consumes 26GB of VRAM
* DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=6144 - Consumes 24GB of VRAM

**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in .gitignore.

### 🚀 Running the Development Server
>>>>>>> 48d3b799435c5f563650cf3ade719ed99182eb8e
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Tip**: Use **Google Chrome Canary** for local testing.

---

## 🧪 Testing
=======
**Note**: You will need Google Chrome Canary to run this locally if you use Chrome! It's an easy install and a good browser for web development anyway.

---

## Testing
>>>>>>> 48d3b799435c5f563650cf3ade719ed99182eb8e

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Ensure you have required permissions and that Wrangler is configured.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

This section outlines the methods for deploying the application using Docker. The processes for **Development** and **Production** are provided separately for clarity.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Development Environment

# Docker Deployment Documentation

This guide outlines various methods for building and deploying the application using Docker.

## Build Methods

### 1. Using Helper Scripts

NPM scripts are provided for convenient building:
>>>>>>> 48d3b799435c5f563650cf3ade719ed99182eb8e

```bash
# Development build
npm run dockerbuild
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

**Option 2: Direct Docker Build Command**

```bash
docker build . --target bolt-ai-development
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose Profile**

```bash
docker-compose --profile development up
```

#### Running the Development Container

```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:development
```

---

### 🏭 Production Environment

#### Build Options

**Option 1: Helper Scripts**

```bash
=======

>>>>>>> 48d3b799435c5f563650cf3ade719ed99182eb8e
# Production build
npm run dockerbuild:prod
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Option 2: Direct Docker Build Command**

```bash
docker build . --target bolt-ai-production
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose Profile**

```bash
docker-compose --profile production up
```

#### Running the Production Container

```bash
=======
### 2. Direct Docker Build Commands

You can use Docker's target feature to specify the build environment:

```bash
# Development build
docker build . --target bolt-ai-development

# Production build
docker build . --target bolt-ai-production
```

### 3. Docker Compose with Profiles

Use Docker Compose profiles to manage different environments:

```bash
# Development environment
docker-compose --profile development up

# Production environment
docker-compose --profile production up
```

---

## Running the Application

After building using any of the methods above, run the container with:

```bash
# Development
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:development

# Production
>>>>>>> 48d3b799435c5f563650cf3ade719ed99182eb8e
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:production
```

### Coolify Deployment

For an easy deployment process, use [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify):

1. Import your Git repository into Coolify.
2. Choose **Docker Compose** as the build pack.
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., API keys).
4. Set the start command:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile production up
   ```

---

## 🛠️ VS Code Dev Containers Integration

The `docker-compose.yaml` configuration is compatible with **VS Code Dev Containers**, making it easy to set up a development environment directly in Visual Studio Code.

### Steps to Use Dev Containers

1. Open the command palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
3. Choose the **development** profile when prompted.
4. VS Code will rebuild the container and open it with the pre-configured environment.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Ensure `.env.local` is configured correctly with:

- API keys.
- Context-specific configurations.

Example for the `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX` variable:

```bash
DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=24576 # Uses 32GB VRAM
```
=======
## Deployment with Coolify

[Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) provides a straightforward deployment process:

1. Import your Git repository as a new project
2. Select your target environment (development/production)
3. Choose "Docker Compose" as the Build Pack
4. Configure deployment domains
5. Set the custom start command:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile production up
   ```
6. Configure environment variables
   - Add necessary AI API keys
   - Adjust other environment variables as needed
7. Deploy the application

---

## VS Code Integration

The `docker-compose.yaml` configuration is compatible with VS Code dev containers:

1. Open the command palette in VS Code
2. Select the dev container configuration
3. Choose the "development" profile from the context menu

---

## Environment Files

Ensure you have the appropriate `.env.local` file configured before running the containers. This file should contain:
- API keys
- Environment-specific configurations
- Other required environment variables

---

## DEFAULT_NUM_CTX

The `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX` environment variable can be used to limit the maximum number of context values used by the qwen2.5-coder model. For example, to limit the context to 24576 values (which uses 32GB of VRAM), set `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=24576` in your `.env.local` file.

First off, thank you for considering contributing to bolt.diy! This fork aims to expand the capabilities of the original project by integrating multiple LLM providers and enhancing functionality. Every contribution helps make bolt.diy a better tool for developers worldwide.

---

## Notes

- Port 5173 is exposed and mapped for both development and production environments
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env.local`
- Different profiles (development/production) can be used for different deployment scenarios
- The configuration supports both local development and production deployment
